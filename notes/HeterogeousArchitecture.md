## Heterogeous architectures
- machines with differents types of processors  
  * they are made to solve different kind of problems   
  * indicates the necessity to converge to a single programming "model"/protocol  

### GPU - Graphical Processing Unit
- outs second processor   
  * is goind to be used along side the normal CPU   

- the Graphic Card became from the need for graphical computing   
  * the CPU could be used, but the performance is crap!   

- it is __not__ supposed to be used for every problem   
  * no silver bullet
